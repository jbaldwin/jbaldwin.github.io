Hello, and welcome to my new blog where I will be writing about anything in software or computer science that interests me, most likely around performance and C++.

Setting up GitHub pages with Jykell took me longer than I'd care to admit being a C++ programmer.  I've found that themes are super useful to making this page look somewhat decent as a backend software engineer.

This post is mostly just myself getting familiar with how to use this platform.
